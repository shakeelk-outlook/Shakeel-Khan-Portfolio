### *A glimpse of the projects I've been working on*  


## [**COVID-19 Analysis**](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Data-Stories-Gallery/COVID-19-Dashboard/td-p/1121420)
### *Which countries has been affected the most?* 
- 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus (more specifically, a coronavirus) identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China. Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread has been occurring. 
- Johns Hopkins University developed a dashboard to track the progression of disease caused by Coronavirus referred as Covid-19. The dataset used for analysis is publically available and can be used to track daily level information with regards to number of case, deaths and recovery. 
- Using the dataset and tools such as Excel and Power BI I have developed real-time dashboards to visualize the data to study the progression of the disease.

## [**Patient Appointment Analysis**](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Data-Stories-Gallery/Patient-Appointment-Analysis/td-p/1118754)
### *What are the factors influencing patient no-show?* 
- Patient no-shows permeate medical practices, across specialties, locations, and practice models. No-shows consistently cause problems for practices and therefore practices track their no-show rate to realize the impact that no-shows can have on both their processes and their revenue. 
- There are many reasons that patients fail to make their appointments and there are demographic similarities across patients who no-show more consistently than others. 
- Using the appointment data provided from a medical practice create visualization and using Power BI I have developed online dashboards and reports to identify trends regarding appointments, no-shows and gain insights regarding variables that affects patient show-up or no-show to the appointment.

## [**USPTO Cancer Patents Analyzer**](https://public.tableau.com/views/USPTO_Cancer_MoonShot_Challenge_2016/Story1?:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link)
### *Which cancer drug research should be funded?* 
- The USPTO Cancer Moonshot Patent Data contains detailed information on published patent applications and granted patents relevant to cancer research and development (R&D). The dataset is generated using USPTO examiner tools to execute a series of queries designed to identify cancer-specific patents and patent applications. 
- USPTO conducted a crowd-sourced competition to develop a tool to analyze patents related to cancer drugs for approval of funding to support R&D efforts.
- Using the data provided by USPTO and using Tableau as visualization tool I developed the analysis and participated in the competition.

## [**Platelet Storage Duration Prediction**](https://github.com/S-A-Khan/Platelet-Storage-Duration-Prediction)
### *How long platelet units are stored in hospital blood banks in United States?* 
- A project to study platelet storage patterns and predict storage duration on the shelf based on historic data from blood banks to help hospitals reduce platelet wasteage.
